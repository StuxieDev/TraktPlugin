# Contributing to Trakt

Thanks for helping out! Issues and pull requests are welcome.

## Development setup

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- A Jellyfin 12.x server to test against. Authorize a Trakt account in the plugin settings to test syncing and scrobbling.

Build with:

```bash
dotnet build Trakt/Trakt.csproj -c Release
```

Before opening a PR, check that the plugin loads, a Trakt account authorizes, and scrobbling plus a library sync work on a real Jellyfin 12 server. There is no automated test suite yet.

## Jellyfin compatibility

The plugin compiles against the `Jellyfin.Controller` / `Jellyfin.Model` NuGet packages for the **lowest** Jellyfin version it supports (currently 12.0.0), and `meta.json`'s `targetAbi` matches. Jellyfin loads a plugin on any server at or above its `targetAbi`, so one build covers every 12.x release. Only raise these when you need an API from a newer release.

## Changelog

Every user-facing change goes into `CHANGELOG.md` under the upcoming version (`## v0.x.y` for now). Use these section headings, in this order, and leave out any that are empty:

1. `### Added`
2. `### Changed`
3. `### Fixed`
4. `### Removed`
5. `### Security`
6. `### Deprecated`

## Releasing

The plugin is pre-stable, so it's versioned with [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) on `0.x.y`: a release that adds or changes anything bumps the minor version (`0.2.0` → `0.3.0`), a fix-only release bumps the patch (`0.2.0` → `0.2.1`). Its first stable release won't be v1.0.0: it will be its first [Date Versioning](https://datevers.ing) release, the UTC release date as `YY.MM.DD` (plus `-1`, `-2`… for later releases the same UTC day, and never a future date), and every release after that is a Date Version too. Declaring the plugin stable is the maintainer's call. Once a Date Version has been tagged, the project never goes back to `0.x`.

To release:

1. Finish the `## v<version>` section in `CHANGELOG.md`. The release workflow copies it into the plugin's changelog in Jellyfin.
2. Put the new version in `VERSION.md` (`0.x.y`, or later `YY.MM.DD` / `YY.MM.DD-N`), and its four-part form in `Directory.Build.props` (`Version`, `AssemblyVersion`, `FileVersion`) and the `version` field of `Trakt/meta.json`: `0.x.y.0`, or later `YY.MM.DD.0` / `YY.MM.DD.N`. `bash scripts/jellyfin-version.sh` prints it. The release workflow sets these anyway.
3. Update `README.md` if anything user-facing changed.
4. Run `bash tests/run.sh` to check the versions line up.
5. Run `./commit.sh` (or `commit.bat` on Windows). It accepts a `0.x.y` version (unless a Date Version tag already exists) or a real, non-future Date Version, and rejects anything else, including `1.x`. It commits everything and creates the tag `v<version>`.
6. Push with `git push origin main --tags`.

Pushing the tag runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`. It checks the versions, builds the plugin and publishes a GitHub Release containing the plugin zip and the repository `manifest.json`. That manifest combines the plugin details in `manifest.template.json` with the version list from the previous release, so Jellyfin always reads it from `releases/latest/download/manifest.json`. Nothing is committed back to the repo.

While the plugin is on `0.x`, the workflow keeps only `0.x` entries from that carried-over list. The releases first published as 1.x and v26.10.23 are now `v0.1.0` to `v0.1.1`, and Jellyfin would always rank their old numbers above every `0.x` release.

**Why four parts in Jellyfin's files:** tags, releases, `VERSION.md` and the changelog use the plain version (`0.2.0`, later `26.10.23` or `26.10.23-1`). Jellyfin's API always reports installed plugin versions with four parts, and its plugin-image endpoint matches versions exactly, so `meta.json` and the manifest use `0.2.0.0` (later `26.10.23.0`, or `26.10.23.1` for `-1`), or the plugin's banner won't load. .NET assembly versions can't contain `-`, so the build uses the four-part form as well.
